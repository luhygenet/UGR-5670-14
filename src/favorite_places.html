          <h2>Langano</h2>
          <p>
            one of the placees we visited most growing up was langano, it was a
            family-favorite and thus we most frequented it most.<br />
            It's beaches and the lake was warm and comforting. some of my
            favorite memories happened right at the shore
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Hawassa</h2>
          <p>
            Hawassa and langano went hand in hand, when we were kids we did not
            visit one without visiting the other.<br />
            When we went there as kids, Hawassa was so green and brimming with
            nature, every short walk doesn't seem short at all. The animals
            seemed to be our friends. The water making it nice and cold. Hawassa
            was certainly a favorite
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Wendo Genet</h2>
          <p>
            Wendo genet was hands down my favorite paradise. On top of the
            fact that it's surname is my mother's name, wendo genet had so
            much to offer to young me. Though it has been years since i've
            vistied, and we didn't visit nearly as much as we did all our
            other destinations, it still had the greatest effect on me and is
            -to this day- my most favorite place
