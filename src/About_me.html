                    <h3>Childhood</h3>
                    <p>I was born on october 16 2003.</br>As a child, I was very adventourous. Me and my older sister were always curious to discover and learn. </br>Our father is very keen on exploring and I suppose that's who we inherited it from. Growing up he would always take us on field trips and try to make us as aware as possible about our surroundings. </br> I attended the same school from kindergarten all the way untill i graduated highschool, which may have made weakened my interaction skills. </p>

                    <h3>Highschool</h3>
                    <p>After I became a teenager, I learned many things about myself. I grew closer to my religion and started being more aware of different situations of my country and the world. </br> I decided I wanted to be a software engineer student then, when I realized I was more of a person who preferred critical thinking instead of cramming. </p>

                    <h3>University</h3>
                    <p>When I enrolled in university in April of 2022, it was a big change, considering I had known and became accustomed to the schoolmates I had my entire life.</br> As time went on I learned and grew. I worked on my sociak anxiety and maintaing my schedule. As of becoming a software engineer, I have been able to learn many new academic and personal skills and hope to continue on this road to mastery. </p>
