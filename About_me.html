          <h3>Childhood</h3>
          <p>
            I was born on october 16 2003.<br />As a child, I was very
            adventourous. Me and my older sister were always curious to discover
            and learn. <br />Our father is very keen on exploring and I suppose
            that's who we inherited it from. Growing up he would always take us
            on field trips and try to make us as aware as possible about our
            surroundings. <br />
            I attended the same school from kindergarten all the way untill i
            graduated highschool, which may have made weakened my interaction
            skills.

          <h3>Highschool</h3>
          <p>
            After I became a teenager, I learned many things about myself. I
            grew closer to my religion and started being more aware of different
            situations of my country and the world. <br />
            I decided I wanted to be a software engineer student then, when I
            realized I was more of a person who preferred critical thinking
            instead of cramming.

          <h3>University</h3>
          <p>
            When I enrolled in university in April of 2022, it was a big change,
            considering I had known and became accustomed to the schoolmates I
            had my entire life.<br />
            As time went on I learned and grew. I worked on my sociak anxiety
            and maintaing my schedule. As of becoming a software engineer, I
            have been able to learn many new academic and personal skills and
            hope to continue on this road to mastery.
